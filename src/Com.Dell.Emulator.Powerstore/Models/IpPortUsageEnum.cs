This usage is no longer applicable to Power Store T appliances, though it may remain on PowerStore T appliances that have been upgraded from a release where it was used. * NVMe_TCP - Can be used for the public storage network via NVMe/TCP. * External_Replication - Can be used for remote system replication or import traffic. * File_Mobility - Can be used for NAS server file replication. * File_Data - Can be used for NAS server file interface configuration. * ICM - Can be used for management within the cluster. * ICD - Can be used for data within the cluster.  Values was added in 2.1.0.0: NVMe_TCP. Values was added in 3.0.0.0: File_Mobility, File_Data. Values was added in 3.5.0.0: ICM, ICD.
